App takes top-down videos of  Wikens parking lot (3 of them), parking lots north of Morris Ave (6), and the train station parking lot (1)

Route: NaaB (no videos taken) -> WIlkens -> North of Morris -> Train Station -> Naab (Still no video here)

* This app only runs on an Android device with an ARM processor. DJI drone apps can only be written for iOS or most Android devices w/ ARM.

* To run the app, first go outside NaaB. Then turn on the drone and the controller. Once the two have connected (drone’s light becomes blinking green), plug the controller into your Android.
* Once you can open the Mavic Pro, press Config to determine where the drone should go after it has completed each waypoint. Then press Start to begin your route.
* Phone needs wifi/data to start script. Once drone is in air, internet connection is no longer necessary.
* Press the Locate button during flight to see the drone’s current location.
* Drone needs full charge to complete the flight.
* Videos are saved to the drone's microSD card.
* The H button on the top-left corner of the controller will abort the drone’s mission and send it  back to its takeoff point in a straight line.

* DO NOT CHARGE BATTERY RIGHT AFTER IT HAS FLOWN. The drone battery is very sensitive to heat, and storing it hot areas such as cars can deteriorate them very quickly.
* DRONE CANNOT BE AUTOMATED TO RELIABLY FLY HIGHER THAN 25M. Manufacturer caps automated flight altitude at 30m, but the drone cannot measure altitude reliably (uses its barometer to estimate altitude). Thus, the drone’s altitude has a 5m margin of error.
* Dji does not have an api to access the drone’s onboard data, thus wirelessly transferring video, telemetry, etc is impossible. Even if you could, the signal becomes too weak to stream video when the drone is ~2000 feet away.
* Drone has ~20 min of battery life. 
* As per the manufacturer, the drone cannot use its collision detection in automated flight. Make sure any route has no obstructions that are 25m high.
